# Weather Dash

## Description

This is a weather dashboard built for Week 6 of the Vanderbilt Full-stack Coding Boot Camp, which uses the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data.

- Search for a city and be presented with current and future conditions.
- A search history of cities previously searched, stored in localStorage.
- Displays city name, date, and icon depicting weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
- Color coding for favorable, moderate, or severe weather.
- Future weather conditions for a city present a 5-day forecast with dates, icons representing weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
- Cities in the search history can be clicked on to reload that data.
